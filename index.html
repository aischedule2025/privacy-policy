  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 31 May 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Mobile World</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles personal information through our internal staff mobile application (the “AI Scheduling App”).</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>The AI Scheduling App is designed exclusively for staff members of <strong>Mobile World</strong> to manage their personal working schedules and preferences. It supports automatic staff assignment based on each staff member's:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Preferred working days</li>
    <li>Actual assigned days</li>
    <li>Teaching subjects and levels</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What Data the App Uses</h2>
  <p>The AI Scheduling App accesses and displays the following personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Teaching subjects and levels</li>
    <li>Assigned working days</li>
    <li>Preferred working days</li>
    <li>Profile picture</li>
    <li>History/Status of leave requests</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is collected and stored via our administrative website, and is not collected directly by the AI Scheduling App, except where noted below.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Collected Within the App</h2>
  <p>The AI Scheduling App only allows staff to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upload or change their profile picture</li>
    <li>Update their preferred working days</li>
    <li>Submit leave requests</li>
    <li>Approve or decline assignment as a temporary staff from another staff's leave request</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These updates are sent securely to our backend database, which is shared with the administrative web platform.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Access and Visibility</h2>
  <p>Each staff member has their own login and can only view their own profile and working schedule. No staff member can access other users’ data through the AI Scheduling App</p>

  <h2>5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>The data accessed or updated in the AI Scheduling App is used solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display your schedule and assignments</li>
    <li>Automatically generate staff assignments</li>
    <li>Support internal workforce planning</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use this data for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All communication between the AI Scheduling App and our server is encrypted using <strong>HTTPS (TLS)</strong>, which ensures your data is securely transmitted over the internet.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Your data is not shared with any third-party services, advertisers, or external entities. It is used only within <strong>Mobile World</strong> for internal operational purposes.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Your information is stored securely and retained as long as you remain an active staff member. </p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
